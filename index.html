        <h2>MDVI Bullet List</h2>
        <ul class="mdvi-bullet-list">
            <li class="mdvi-1"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="img/Early_Identification_Color_Icon-01.png" />Medical professionals often lack awareness about the benefits of timely intervention that can greatly improve and develop a child’s functional abilities.</li>
            <li class="mdvi-2"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="img/Early_Intervention_Color_Icon-01.png" />Distance, limited transportation, physical challenges, or scarcity of services makes it difficult for many families to access the nearest school, Anganwadi, therapists or medical services - particularly in rural areas.</li>
            <li class="mdvi-3"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="img/Early_Childhood_Education_Color_Icon-01.png" />Children with MDVI receive incorrect diagnoses and lose years of early development, which are foundational to success in school and life.</li>
            <li class="mdvi-4"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="img/Primary_Secondary_Ed_Color_Icon-01.png" />Most schools are not equipped to successfully educate children with a complex profile like MDVI, so families have no choice but to keep them at home.</li>
            <li class="mdvi-5"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="img/Family_Involvement_Color_Icon-01.png" />Many families struggle to understand their children’s learning needs; while they care deeply about their children and want them to have the best possible future, they do not know where to turn for assistance and resources.</li>
            <li class="mdvi-6"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="img/healh_color_icon_v2-01.png" />Many medical professionals lack the expertise to appropriately screen newborns or children with various disabilities for visual impairment so they often go unassessed.</li>
        </ul>
